A double-solitaire game built on top of a card game engine, made in React.

I've always been fascinated by the dynamics of this card game.
I look forward to getting to the AI part of it.

I'm relatively new to the React/Javascript world so am using this project to familiarize myself.

I'm keeping the game state logic (engine) separate from the react app in hopes that it could be re-used elsewhere.
React Native at some point?
